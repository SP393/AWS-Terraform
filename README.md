# AWS Infrastructure Automation with Terraform

This project automates the deployment of AWS resources such as **Lambda**, **S3**, **IAM**, **Cognito**, and **API Gateway** using **Terraform**. The scripts are optimized to create multiple Lambda functions with API Gateway paths for efficient serverless architecture management.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Lambda Functions**: Create and manage multiple Lambda functions with customizable API Gateway endpoints.
- **S3**: Automate S3 bucket creation for static storage.
- **IAM**: Configure IAM roles and policies for secure access management.
- **Cognito**: Set up user authentication and authorization using AWS Cognito.
- **API Gateway**: Automatically generate API Gateway resources and routes for Lambda functions.
- **Optimized Scripts**: Efficient Terraform configurations to create multiple Lambda functions with individual API Gateway paths.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **AWS Lambda** for serverless compute
- **API Gateway** for managing HTTP endpoints
- **IAM** for access control
- **Cognito** for authentication
- **S3** for static storage
